## Minimum Requirements

* Erlang OTP 21+
* rebar3 3.9.1+

## Quickstart

Compile the project:

    make

## Command-line Arguments

These are the command-line arguments that can be provided to the
`erlang_ls` escript:

| Argument                | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --transport tcp / stdio | Specifies the transport the server will use for the connection with the client (default: `tcp`) |
| --port PORT             | Used when the transport is `tcp` (default: `10000`)                                             |
| --log-dir DIR           | Directory where logs will be written. When not provided no logs are generated.                  |

### Emacs Setup

The official `lsp-mode` package includes a client for the Erlang
Language Server.

[Here](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls/blob/master/misc/dotemacs)
you can find a sample Emacs configuration file which installs and
configures all packages required to get all of the Erlang LS features
working. Use this configuration file as a starting point for your
Erlang LS Emacs configuration.

Whenever opening a project for the first time, you will be prompted by
`emacs-lsp` to select the correct project root. In that occasion, you
also have the opportunity to _blacklist_ projects. Information about
projects is stored in a file pointed by the `lsp-session-file`
variable. Its default location is `~/.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1`. You
may need to prune or amend this file if you change your mind about
blacklisting a project or if you erroneously select a project
root. For more information about the `lsp-session-file` and
`emacs-lsp` in general, please refer to the [official
documentation](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/blob/master/README.org).

Remember that the Erlang Language Server requires Erlang/OTP 21 or
higher to run, so ensure that OTP 21+ is available in your `PATH`.
This can be achieved, for example, by using the
[exec-path-from-shell](https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell)
Emacs package.

#### Troubleshooting the Emacs Setup

If things do not work as expected, we advise you to start Emacs with
only the configuration from the provided sample file, using the
following command:

    emacs -q -l [PATH-TO-ERLANG-LS]/misc/dotemacs

This will remove from the equation potential incompatibilities with
other packages or configurations that you may have on your workstation
and that could conflict with Erlang LS.

To be sure that you don't have outdated or incompatible packages
installed, you may also want to rename your `~/.emacs.d` directory
while you are troubleshooting your Erlang LS Emacs setup.

Also, ensure that Erlang (i.e. `erl`, `escript` and friends) and the
`erlang_ls` executable are all available in your `PATH`. If they are
not, you can try the following:

```elisp
;; Ensure your Emacs environment looks like your user's shell one
(package-require 'exec-path-from-shell)
(exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
```

Finally, to enable logging on the client-side, just:

```elisp
(setq lsp-log-io t)
```

### VSCode Setup

The Erlang Language Server is available in VSCode via a [dedicated
extension](https://github.com/erlang-ls/vscode).

To try it out, simply open VSCode and install the extension via the
Marketplace:

    Preferences > Extensions

Look for the `erlang-ls` extension and install it. That's it.

Remember that the Erlang Language Server requires Erlang/OTP 21 or
higher to run, so ensure that OTP 21+ is available in your `PATH`.

#### Theia IDE

It is possible to use Erlang LS in Theia IDE by including Erlang/OTP
in your running instance and installing the
[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=erlang-ls.erlang-ls).

If you want to give it a try by using GitPod click
[here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls).
To use this same setup with your Erlang project (hosted in GitHub or
Gitlab) you can find the GitPod configuration in
[`.gitpod.yml`](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls/blob/master/.gitpod.yml).

### Sublime Text 3 Setup

Using the _Command Palette_, select `Package Control: Install Package`
and install the `LSP` package.

After that is done, go to:

    Preferences -> Package Settings -> LSP -> Settings

Add an Erlang client by adding the following configuration to the
`LSP.sublime-settings - User` file:

    {
      "clients":
        {
          "erlang-ls":
            {
              "command"   : [ "/path/to/my/erlang_ls", "--transport", "stdio" ],
              "enabled"   : true,
              "languageId": "erlang",
              "scopes"    : [ "source.erlang" ],
              "syntaxes"  : ["Packages/Erlang/Erlang.sublime-syntax"]
            }
        }
    }

That's it. Open a new Erlang project and enjoy Erlang LS.

#### Troubleshooting the Sublime Text 3 Setup

In case of issues, you can enable extra logging for the `LSP` package
by adding the following configuration to your `LSP.sublime-settings -
User` file:

    {
      // Show verbose debug messages in the sublime console.
      "log_debug": true,

      // Show messages from language servers in the Language Servers output
      // panel.
     "log_server": true,

      // Show language server stderr output in the Language Servers output
      // panel.
      "log_stderr": true,

      // Show full JSON-RPC requests/responses/notifications in the Language
      // Servers output panel.
      "log_payloads": true
    }

The Sublime console can be toggled using the `` Ctrl-` `` shortcut. The
output panel can be toggled from the command palette with the command
`LSP: Toggle Panel: Language Servers`.

### IntelliJ Setup

> **WARNING**: The current version of the IntelliJ LSP plugin (1.5.4)
> is quite limited, so not all of the Erlang Language Server
> capabilities are available in IntelliJ.

First of all, ensure you have the [LSP
Support](https://github.com/gtache/intellij-lsp) plugin installed. If
you don't, you can simply navigate to:

    Preferences > Plugins > Browse Repositories

Search for "LSP Support" and install the respective plugin.

Restart IntelliJ, then navigate to:

    Preferences > Languages and Frameworks > Language Server Protocol > Server Definitions

There you can instruct IntelliJ on how to start the server. Select
`Raw Command`, set `erl;hrl` as the extension, then add as the
command:

    /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/erlang_ls/_build/debug/bin/erlang_ls --transport stdio

Ensure you use an absolute path. The plugin does not seem to
understand the `~` symbol. For the above command to work, IntelliJ
requires the `PATH` variable to be correctly configured to include
Erlang 20+. To circumvent this issues on Mac OS, the best way is to
start IntelliJ from the terminal (i.e. via the `idea` command) and not
via Spotlight.

To visualize documentation and type specs while hovering a function,
ensure the _Show quick documentation on mouse move_ option is enabled
in your IntelliJ preferences:

    Preferences > Editor > General

There, you can also set a delay in milliseconds.

For more information about how to configure the IntelliJ LSP Client,
please refer to the project [GitHub
page](https://github.com/gtache/intellij-lsp).

#### Troubleshooting the IntelliJ Setup

In some cases, the IntelliJ LSP client may not be able to connect to
the server. In such cases, the first step is to enable logging:

    Preferences > Languages and Frameworks > Language Server Protocol

Check the _Log servers communications_ check-box there.

After restarting IntelliJ, you will notice an extra `lsp` directory
created inside your Erlang project. This directory contains the
`error` and `output` logs, which should give you a hint about what is
going on.

An alternative source of information is represented by the IntelliJ
logs:

    Help > Show Logs

### NeoVim Setup

**Note**: While these instructions are for NeoVim, they should be transferable
to Vim.

For [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) users, install
[Coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) and its plugin
[coc-erlang_ls](https://github.com/hyhugh/coc-erlang_ls) by entering the
following in your `init.vim` or `.vimrc` plugin section:

```vim
" Use release branch (Recommend)
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
Plug 'hyhugh/coc-erlang_ls', {'do': 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile'}
```

You should ensure your `yarn` has frozen-lockfile support (current version
distributed by `brew` does not). Then restart vim and run `:PlugInstall`. If
the erlang_ls server is running, and you have [configured the CoC
plugin](https://github.com/hyhugh/coc-erlang_ls#config), then when vim starts
you should see the message that Coc has connected to it:

```vim
[coc.nvim] coc-erlang_ls is ready
```

For suggestions on configuring Coc see its [example configuration
documentation](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim#example-vim-configuration).

## Features

This section summarizes the functionalities currently implemented by
the `erlang_ls` server.

### Code Navigation

Code navigation is currently available for the following elements:

* Function applications (both local and remote)
* BIFs
* Behaviour attributes
* Included files
* Type definitions
* Record definitions
* Macro definitions
* Export list entries
* Import list entries

### Code Completion

Completion requests are sent from the client to the server to compute
completion items at a given cursor position. Completion items are
presented to the user for easy selection.

Code completion are currently triggered by the following characters:
`:`, `?`.

Code completion is available for the following elements:

* Exported functions

## Customization

It is possible to customize the behaviour of the `erlang_ls` server
via a configuration file, named `erlang_ls.config`. The
`erlang_ls.config` file should be placed in the root directory of a
given project to store the configuration for that project.

It is also possible to store a system-wide default configuration in an
`erlang_ls.config` file located in the _User Config_ directory. The
exact location of the _User Config_ directory depends on the operating
system used and it can be identified by executing the following
command on an Erlang shell:

    > filename:basedir(user_config, "erlang_ls").

Normally, the location of the _User Config_ directory is:

| Operating System | User Config Directory                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Linux            | /home/USER/.config/erlang\_ls                       |
| OS X             | /Users/USER/Library/Application\ Support/erlang\_ls |
| Windows          | c:/Users/USER/AppData/Local/erlang\_ls              |

A sample `erlang_ls.config` file would look like the following:

```yaml
otp_path: "/path/to/otp/lib/erlang"
deps_dirs:
  - "lib/*"
include_dirs:
  - "include"
  - "_build/default/lib"
macros:
  - name: DEFINED_WITH_VALUE
    value: 42
  - name: DEFINED_WITHOUT_VALUE
code_reload:
  node: node@example
```

The file format is `yaml`.

The following customizations are possible:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| otp\_path          | Path to the OTP installation                                                                                                              |
| plt\_path          | Path to the dialyzer PLT file. When none is provided the dialyzer diagnostics will not be available.                                      |
| deps\_dirs         | List of directories containing dependencies. It supports wildcards.                                                                       |
| apps\_dirs         | List of directories containing project applications. It supports wildcards.                                                               |
| include\_dirs      | List of directories provided to the compiler as include dirs. It supports wildcards.                                                      |
| macros             | List of cusom macros to be passed to the compiler, expressed as a name/value pair. If the value is omitted or is invalid, 'true' is used. |
| otp\_apps\_exclude | List of OTP applications that will not be indexed (default: megaco, diameter, snmp, wx)                                                   |
| code\_reload       | Whether or not an rpc call should be made to a remote node to compile and reload a module                                                 |

The `code_reload` takes a list of the following options:
| Parameter | Description                                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| node      | The node to be called for code reloading. Example erlang_ls@hostname |

## Troubleshooting

It is possible to compile and start the language server in _debug mode_:

    rebar3 as debug escriptize

Ensure you update your `PATH` to include the new executable which now
resides in:

    /path/to/erlang_ls/_build/debug/bin/erlang_ls

Once an instance of the server is running, find the name of the node in
the [logs](#logs) or by running `epmd -names`. It will look something like:

    $ epmd -names
    epmd: up and running on port 4369 with data:
    name erlang_ls_62880311918 at port 50819

And you can connect to it via:

    erl -sname debug -remsh erlang_ls_62880311918@`HOSTNAME`

The [redbug](https://github.com/massemanet/redbug) application is
included in _debug mode_, so feel free to use it.

### The `erlang_ls` Database

The `erlang_ls` language server uses
[Mnesia](https://erlang.org/doc/man/mnesia.html) to persist
information. A new database is created and maintained for each
project/OTP pair. Databases are stored in the application cache
directory, which varies according to the operating system used.

Generally speaking, the directory should be:

| Operating System | Database Dir                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Linux            | /home/USER/.cache/erlang\_ls                 |
| OS X             | /Users/USER/Library/Caches/erlang\_ls        |
| Windows          | c:/Users/USER/AppData/Local/erlang\_ls/Cache |

You can also run the following command on an Erlang shell to identify
the Database Directory on your system:

    > filename:basedir(user_cache, "erlang_ls").

### Logging

When the escript is built using the `debug` profile as above, logging
will be enabled and the logs will be written to your platform's log
directory (i.e. the return value from `filename:basedir(user_log,
"erlang_ls")`), in a file named `server.log`.

It's possible to customize the logging directory by using the
`--log-dir` option when starting the server.

It's also possible to specify the verbosity of the logs by using the
`--log-level` option. In addition to the `notice`, `debug`, `info`,
`warning` and `error` levels, [syslog style loglevel comparison
flags](https://github.com/erlang-lager/lager#syslog-style-loglevel-comparison-flags)
can also be used.

When the `escript` is built in the `default` mode (i.e. `rebar3 escript`),
no log files are generated, unless the `--log-dir` option is provided.

## Getting in Touch

If you have any questions about the project, feel free to open a new
issue. You can also join the `#language-server` channel in the
_Erlanger_ Slack if you would like to get involved or if you prefer a
more informal mean of communication.

All contributions are welcome, be them in the form of a bug report, a
question, feedback, or code.

A [wiki](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls/wiki) is also
available and I occasionally blog about the project on
[Medium](https://medium.com/about-erlang).
